VARIABLE AND DATATYPES:

1.What is the difference between varaiable and datatype in c? Illustrate with example

Variable:

A variable is a named storage location in the computer's memory.
It is used to hold data that can be modified during program execution.
Variables are declared using a specific name and optionally initialized with a value.
They provide a way to refer to and manipulate data within a program.
Examples of variables in C: int age, float temperature, char grade.

Data Type:

A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can hold.
It defines the set of values that a variable can store and the operations that can be performed on it.
C has several built-in data types, such as int, float, char, double, etc.
Data types determine the size and format of the stored data in memory.
They provide constraints and rules for storing and manipulating data.
Examples of data types in C: int (integer), float (floating-point number), char (character), double (double-precision floating-point number).
eg:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Example of a variable and its data type
    int age = 25; // Here, 'age' is a variable of type 'int' (integer)
    
    // Example of using the variable
    printf("I am %d years old.\n", age); // %d is a placeholder for an integer
    
    return 0;
}
2.Explain the concept of datatype in c programming.Discuss the different od dataypes available in C
  Basic Data Types:

These are fundamental data types provided by C.
They include:
int: Used to store integer values.
char: Used to store a single character.
float: Used to store single-precision floating-point numbers.
double: Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers.

Derived Data Types:

These data types are derived from the basic data types.
They include:
Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type.
Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses.
Structures: User-defined data types that can hold multiple variables of different data types under a single name.
Unions: Similar to structures, but they share the same memory location for all members.

Enumeration Data Type:

Enumeration (enum) data type allows you to define a set of named integer constants.
It provides a way to define a list of related named constants.

Void Data Type:

void is a special data type that represents the absence of type.
It is commonly used to indicate that a function does not return any value.

3. How are variables declared and initialized in C programming.Provide examples of variable declarations with different datatypes 

 #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Variable declarations with initialization
    int age = 25; // Integer variable initialized with value 25
    float temperature = 98.6; // Floating-point variable initialized with value 98.6
    char grade = 'A'; // Character variable initialized with value 'A'
    double pi = 3.14159; // Double precision floating-point variable initialized with value 3.14159
    
    // Variable declarations without initialization
    int num1; // Integer variable declared without initialization
    float num2; // Floating-point variable declared without initialization
    char letter; // Character variable declared without initialization
    double value; // Double precision floating-point variable declared without initialization
    
    // Assigning values to variables later in the program
    num1 = 10;
    num2 = 3.14;
    letter = 'B';
    value = 2.71828;
    
    // Printing values of variables
    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Temperature: %.2f\n", temperature);
    printf("Grade: %c\n", grade);
    printf("Pi: %.5f\n", pi);
    
    printf("Num1: %d\n", num1);
    printf("Num2: %.2f\n", num2);
    printf("Letter: %c\n", letter);
    printf("Value: %.5f\n", value);
    
    return 0;
}


4. Discuss the scope and lifetime of variables in C programming.What are global and local variables
   
Global Variables:
Global variables are declared outside of any function in a C program.
They can be accessed from any part of the program, including all functions.
Global variables have file scope, meaning they are visible throughout the file in which they are declared.
They retain their values throughout the program's execution.
Example:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

// Global variable declaration
int globalVar = 10;

int main() {
    // Accessing globalVar from main function
    printf("Global variable: %d\n", globalVar);
    return 0;
}
Local Variables:
Local variables are declared within a function or a block of code.
They can only be accessed from within the function or block in which they are declared.
Local variables have block scope, meaning they are visible only within the block in which they are declared.
They are created when the function or block is entered and destroyed when the function or block exits.
Example:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

void function() {
    // Local variable declaration
    int localVar = 20;
    printf("Local variable: %d\n", localVar);
}

int main() {
    // Accessing localVar from the function
    function();
    return 0;
}
Lifetime of Variables:

Global Variables:

Global variables exist for the entire duration of the program's execution.
They are allocated memory when the program starts and deallocated when the program terminates.
Local Variables:

Local variables exist only within the function or block in which they are declared.
They are allocated memory when the function or block is entered and deallocated when the function or block exits.

5.Explain the concept of type casting in C programming.When is type casting necessary,and how it is performed?
Implicit Type Casting:

Implicit type casting, also known as "automatic" or "coercion," occurs automatically by the compiler when values of different data types are used together in expressions.
The compiler promotes smaller data types to larger data types to avoid loss of data.
For example, when an integer is assigned to a float, the integer is automatically promoted to a float.

Example:

int num1 = 10;
float num2 = num1; // Implicit type casting from int to float
Explicit Type Casting:

Explicit type casting is performed manually by the programmer using the casting operator (datatype).
It allows you to explicitly convert a value from one data type to another.
Explicit type casting is necessary when you want to force a conversion that may result in data loss or when the compiler cannot perform automatic conversion.

Example:

float num1 = 3.14;
int num2 = (int)num1; // Explicit type casting from float to int

POINTERS:
1.Describe the purpose and usage of pointers in C programming .How are pointers are declared and initialized?

 Declaration of pointers:
 Dynamic Memory Allocation: Pointers enable dynamic memory allocation using functions like malloc(), calloc(), and realloc(), which allow you to allocate memory at runtime and manage it as needed.

Passing Parameters: Pointers are often used to pass parameters to functions by reference, rather than by value. This allows functions to modify variables outside of their local scope.

Efficient Data Structures: Pointers facilitate the creation and manipulation of complex data structures like linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic arrays.

Direct Memory Access: Pointers provide a way to directly access and manipulate memory locations, which can be useful for low-level programming tasks.

Initialization of Pointers:
Pointers can be initialized in several ways:

Direct Address Assignment: You can assign the memory address of a variable to a pointer directly using the address-of operator (&). For example:

int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num; // Pointer ptr now points to the memory location of num
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Pointers are commonly initialized with the result of memory allocation functions (malloc(), calloc(), etc.). For example:

int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int)); // Allocates memory for an integer and assigns the address to ptr
NULL Initialization: It's good practice to initialize pointers to NULL if they are not pointing to any valid memory location initially. This helps avoid undefined behavior. For example:

int *ptr = NULL; // Pointer initialized to NULL
Pointing to Existing Variables: You can also initialize pointers to point to existing variables. For example:

int num = 5;
int *ptr = &num;

2.Explain the concept of pointer arithmeticin C programming.Provide examples to illustrate addition and subtraction operations on pointers

  ADDITION OF AN ARRAY:

  #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr = arr; // Pointer to the first element of the array

    // Print the elements of the array using pointer arithmetic
    printf("Array elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", *ptr); // Print the value at the memory location pointed to by ptr
        ptr++; // Move the pointer to the next element
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
 SUBTRACTION OF AN ARRAY:

 #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr = &arr[4]; // Pointer to the last element of the array

    // Print the elements of the array in reverse order using pointer arithmetic
    printf("Array elements in reverse order: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", *ptr); // Print the value at the memory location pointed to by ptr
        ptr--; // Move the pointer to the previous element
    }
    printf("\n");

3.Discuss the difference between pass by value and pass by reference in function arguments using pointers in C programming provide examples illustrate to both approaches 

 Pass by Value:
In pass by value, a copy of the actual argument's value is passed to the function. This means any modifications made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument. Pass by value is suitable when you want to ensure that the original data remains unchanged.

Example:

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to increment a number using pass by value
void increment(int num) {
    num++; // Increment the parameter
    printf("Inside function: %d\n", num);
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;

    printf("Before function call: %d\n", num);
    increment(num); // Call the function with num
    printf("After function call: %d\n", num); // num remains unchanged

    return 0;
}
Output:


Before function call: 5
Inside function: 6
After function call: 5
In this example, even though the increment function modifies the parameter num, the original num in the main function remains unchanged because it was passed by value.

Pass by Reference (using Pointers):
In pass by reference, instead of passing the actual value, a reference (i.e., memory address) to the original variable is passed to the function. This allows the function to directly modify the original variable's value. Pointers are typically used to achieve pass by reference in C.

Example:

#include <stdio.h>

// Function to increment a number using pass by reference
void incrementByRef(int *ptr) {
    (*ptr)++; // Increment the value at the memory location pointed to by ptr
    printf("Inside function: %d\n", *ptr);
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;

    printf("Before function call: %d\n", num);
    incrementByRef(&num); // Pass the address of num
    printf("After function call: %d\n", num); // num is modified

    return 0;
}
Output:


Before function call: 5
Inside function: 6
After function call: 6
